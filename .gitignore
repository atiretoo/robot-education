# If using PlatformIO, its build output goes into .pioenvs/ or .pio/

# Arduino libraries downloaded into sketch folder (should be in global libs or explicitly included)
# If you have libraries specific to THIS project and you want to include them,
# you might need to adjust this. Generally, library code should be versioned
# separately or managed via platformio.ini for PlatformIO projects.
# For simple Arduino IDE projects, if you put libraries directly in the sketch folder,
# you might want to remove these lines if you intend to commit them.
# Example: If you have a 'libraries' folder inside a sketch folder:
# libraries/*
# !libraries/.gitkeep # If you want to keep the folder but ignore contents

# --- OpenSCAD Specific Exclusions ---

*.bak

# Exported 3D model files (unless you want to commit specific versions)
# These are often derived from the .scad files and can be regenerated.
